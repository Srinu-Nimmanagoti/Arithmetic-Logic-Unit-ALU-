# 🗒️ Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-(ALU)-Verilog | Vivado
This Verilog implementation presents a basic 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting five core operations: addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), bitwise AND, OR, and NOT. The design takes two 8-bit inputs (a and b) and a 3-bit operation code (op) to select the desired operation, producing an 8-bit result and a zero_flag that indicates when the output equals zero. The testbench verifies all operations with clear decimal and binary test cases, demonstrating correct functionality for arithmetic calculations (10+20=30) and logical operations (10101010 AND 11001100=10001000), including zero detection (100-100 sets zero_flag). 
# Components
# Inputs:
a (8-bit) – First operand for arithmetic/logical operations.
b (8-bit) – Second operand (except for NOT, which uses only a).
op (3-bit) – Operation selector (determines which operation to perform).
# Outputs:
result (8-bit) – Output of the selected operation.
zero_flag (1-bit) – Becomes 1 if result == 0, else 0.
# Operation Table

🚀 Launch Sequence
bash
# 1️⃣ Beam down the code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BitBender-3000.git
cd BitBender-3000

# 2️⃣ Initiate quantum simulation
./launch_sequence.sh

# 3️⃣ For the full light show (requires GTKWave)
./light_driver.sh --party-mode
Sample Output:

⚡ POWERING UP BITBENDER 3000 ⚡

🔢 Arithmetic Arena:
   ADD: 8 + 8 = 16 (Zero? ❌)  
   SUB: 16 - 4 = 12 (Zero? ❌)

🎭 Logic Theater:
   AND: 1100 & 1010 = 1000  
   OR:  1100 | 1010 = 1110  
   NOT: ~1100 = 0011 (Mind=Blown!)

🎯 Zero Moment: 8 - 8 = 0 (Zero? ✅👁️)
💎 Why Engineers Love This
• Zero-Drama Flag - Knows when to say "0"
• Bitwise Ninja - AND/OR/NOT moves smoother than a hacker movie
• Plug-and-Play - Fits in any CPU design like the last puzzle piece
• Comment-Rich - No hieroglyphics here!

🔮 Roadmap to World Domination
XOR Gate - For that extra spice

Shift Operations - Make bits boogie left and right

Neon Waveforms - Because debug logs deserve glam too
